Either Run the scipts or the Pyinstaller Exe. Putting the exe in your path makes life a lot easier

# Wig.py

## Overview
Wig.py is a command-line tool that simplifies searching for and installing software packages using the Windows Package Manager (`winget`). It processes package data from the Winget-Pkgs repository and provides an interactive interface to search and install applications.

## Features
- **Fast Package Search:** Uses fuzzy matching to quickly find relevant packages.
- **Interactive Selection:** Displays search results in a formatted table, allowing users to select and install packages easily.
- **Automatic Data Processing:** Downloads and processes Winget package data from the official Microsoft GitHub repository.
- **Efficient Storage:** Utilizes MessagePack for compact and fast data storage.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 with `winget` installed.
- Python 3.x installed.
- Required Python packages:
  ```sh
  pip install msgpack fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein requests pyyaml
  ```

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wig.git
cd wig
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Process Winget Package Data
Before searching, the package data must be downloaded and processed:
```sh
python zip_processor.py
```
This will:
- Download the latest `winget-pkgs` data(packages names and descriptions) from GitHub.
- Extract relevant package details.
- Store the data in MessagePack format for quick access.

### Step 2: Search for Packages
Run `wig.py` to search for packages interactively:
```sh
python wig.py
```
- Enter a keyword to search for packages.
- Select a package from the results by entering its corresponding number.
- Confirm installation when prompted.

### Step 3: Install a Package
Once a package is selected, `wig.py` will open a new terminal window to execute the `winget install` command.

## File Structure
```
wig/
│── wig.py               # Main script for searching and installing packages
│── zip_processor.py  # Script to download and process package data
│── README.md            # Project documentation
│── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
```

## Notes
- Running `wig.py` requires `package_data.msgpack` and `index.msgpack`, generated by `zip_processor.py`.
- If `winget` is not available in your system's PATH, ensure it is properly installed and configured.
